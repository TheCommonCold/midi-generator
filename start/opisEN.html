<h1>User part</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The purpose of this software is to create various music phrases. The software is capable of producing both melodies
    as well as chord progressions.
    This software assumes user participation. The user evaluates each phrase which influences the next generation of
    phrases that the software produces. The user can evolve the phrases until the results become satisfying.</p>

<h2>User interface</h2>

<p>The user interface consists of two sections. The first section contains all of the parameters that the software uses.
    The second section consists of generated phrases that can be played, scored and downloaded in midi format.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>Population size</b> – number of phrases in a population</p>
<p><b>Mutation chance</b> – the probability of a random mutation occurring when generating a phrase in the next
    generation</p>
<p><b>Tempo</b> – the tempo of phrases (in other words, this parameter controls the playback speed)</p>
<p><b>Chord complexity</b> – the harmonic complexity of the generated chords</p>
<p><b>Min. note length</b> – minimum length of notes occurring within a phrase</p>
<p><b>Max. note length</b> – maximum length of notes occurring within a phrase</p>
<p><b>No. of notes in a chord</b> – number of notes that can occur in one given time moment, setting this parameter to 1
    results in melodies being generated instead of chords</p>
<p><b>Phrase length</b> – the length of generated phrases</p>

<p>There are two buttons that the user can click: <b>RESTART</b> and <b>NEXT GENERATION</b>:</p>
<p><b>RESTART</b> – regenerates the initial generation of phrases</p>
<p><b>NEXT GENERATION</b> – generates the next generation of phrases</p>

<h3>Phrases</h3>

<p>The phrases are presented as midi. By clicking the buttons on a given phrase the user can increase or decrease the
    phrase's score as well as just play the phrase . In top left corner of a given phrase there is a button that lets
    the
    user download the phrase in midi format.
</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>First of all the user can adjust all of the parameters. The initial values should provide some interesting results.
    Next, the user should listen to the phrases and evaluate them using the arrow buttons on each of the phrases.
    After evaluating the phrases the user should click the <b>NEXT GENERATION</b> button.
    This process should be repeated until the results are satisfying.</p>

<h1>Technical part</h1>

<h2>First generation</h2>

<p>The first generation of phrases is generated randomly. Firt, the rhythm of a phrase is generated. It is generated
    by picking a random length from an array of predefined note lengths. The rhythm generation is controlled by
    <b>Min. note length</b> and <b>Max. note length</b> parameters. The sum of all the lengths that the rhythm consists
    of is equal <b>Phrase length</b>. Then the scale is chosen.
    For every length in the rhythm array a base note is randomly chosen. From that base note a chord is constructed.
    The chords are constructed from a predefined array of intervals. The number of notes in a chord is controlled by the
    Number of Notes parameter while the harmonic complexity of the chords are controlled by the <b>Chord complexity</b>
    parameter.
</p>

<h2>Subsequent generations</h2>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>The process of generating the subsequent generations starts with evaluating each phrase. A phrase can
    be awarded a score number ranging from 0 to 10. Each phrase starts with a score of 1. Setting the score to 0 will
    result in banning a phrase from influencing the next generation.</p>

<h3>Selection</h3>

<p> The population of a subsequent generation is created through recombination of genes from two specimens and random
    mutations. Specimen selection
    is done using the roulette wheel selection</p>

<h3>Crossover</h3>

<p>The crossover process starts with choosing a common scale to which both parents are transposed. Then a rhythm of the
    offspring is constructed using the beginnings and end of the notes from both parents. For every length that the new
    rhythm consists of a pool of notes that exists at a given time grain are gathered. From that pool a base note is
    randomly chosen for every length in the offspring's rhythm.
    From that base note a chord is constructed using the same process as the first generation of phrases. The only
    difference is that the harmonies are chosen from the same pool of notes from which the base notes were chosen.
    The complexity of the chord is still controlled by the <b>Chord complexity</b> parameter.
</p>

<h3>Mutations</h3>

<p>The mutation chance is set by the <b>Mutation chance</b> parameter. In this software 3 types of mutations exist:</p>

<p>Scale mutation – transposition of phrase by one semitone up or down </p>

<p>Rhythm mutation – cutting a chord and inserting a new one or joining two chords together </p>

<p>Melody mutation – deleting a chord and inserting a new one in its place</p>
